# Data Scientist
This is for the Data Scientist course from John Hopkins University taken on Coursea in July 2015. I have found that this course is very well created and the instruction is very straight forward. I will continue adding to this repo as I matriculate through this course and eventually take all courses to receive my certification as a data scientist.

## Here are the Courses

* The Data Scientist's Toolbox
* R Programming
* Getting and Cleaning Data
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Reproducable Research
* Statistical Inference
* Regression Models
* Pratical Machine Learning
* Developing Data Products
* Data Science Capstone
